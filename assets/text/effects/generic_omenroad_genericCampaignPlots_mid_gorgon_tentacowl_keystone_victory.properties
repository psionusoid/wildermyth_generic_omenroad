~01~~panel_001~1_narration=It's a hill library of the kind quiet-loving scholars make. \nIt's not an uncommon thing to find, isolated.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The interior of this one has been wholly riffled through.
~01~~panel_002~2_hero2=<hero2.exists:<deadHero.exists:Burials are next, [face:grim]I suppose./<hero2.greedy/loner/poet/60:Can probably assume the owners are dead. Anything look interesting enough to lug around?/[face:grim]This's why you have to be able to defend yourself. \nIf you're going to live out here./[face:grim]No one is more familiar with doom than the collector. The inevitability of scatter and ruin./Hopefully the owners, or whoever was here... got away.>>/>
~01~~panel_003~2_hero=<hero2.exists:<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]Hold off for a bit, I think. We need to see if this ragged mess [i]means[] anything./<hero2.greedy/loner/poet/60:Hm? I don't know./Yeah? Yeah. You're not wrong about that./Hm./Oh? Yeah. Yeah, right, hopefully they did.> <hero.bookish/goofball/hothead/loner/poet/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]It's hideous to me, just the disorganization that they left. Cleaning it up feels important. And to figure out what they were looking for...?/Looks like they really had a hunger for some fresh stories, huh? The <threat.plural>?[face:talking]/[face:grim]These garbage <threat.cdgmt:cultists leave their dirt and junk everywhere./lizards leave their junk everywhere./gorgonoids left their blue gunk on everything./bonelings always leave junk everywhere./weevils left their gum and molting on everything.> So.../This'll be a task. Makes me glad I've got <hero3.exists:others to help, actually./you to help, actually.>[face:grim]/We stand in a flower garden, all the earth tossed and turned over. The roots showing./This is a truly wonderful set of myths and journals. I wonder if the <threat.plural> found... whatever they were looking for./I wonder if it [i]does[] mean something, their weird bookhunt?> Probably have to dig around a bit.>/<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]Well, <deadHero.2.exists:friends, I suppose it's on me to see if this ragged mess was worth your lives./<deadHero>, I suppose it's on me to see if this ragged mess was worth your life.>/Now I guess I try and see if this \nragged mess means anything.[face:skeptical]>>
~01~~panel_003~3_hero2=<hero2.exists:<deadHero.exists:[face:grim]/<hero2.rfln.hero:[face:dubious]I was already starting to./[face:neutral]Mm, right. Let's see what we can see./[face:neutral]Sure, love. Let's rest and shift some shelves. [small]\n[i]Shift some shelves, shift some shelves.[] That's tongue exercise./>>/>
~01~~panel_004~1_narration=There's not much peculiar in here: known fictions and favorite legends, some ancient translations, some sketches, some journals.
~01~~panel_004~2_narration=At least one thing's clear...
~01~~panel_005~3_hero=<hero2.exists:Maps. All the maps have been unrolled, atlases paged through. I can't tell if any are missing./>
~01~~panel_005~4_hero=<hero2.exists:/Maps. All the maps have been unrolled, atlases paged through. Wish I could tell what's missing.>
~01~~panel_005~5_hero3=<hero3.exists:I was noticing that, too./>
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<hero2.exists:/The <threat.plural> seem to be searching for a place or thing long forgotten.>
~01~~panel_006~6_hero4=<hero4.exists:[small]The foodcellar here's <threat.cdgmt:been raided. Probably just a practicality, but wanted to mention it.[face:skeptical]/been raided. Probably just a practicality, but wanted to mention it.[face:skeptical]/gotten gross. The beasts seem to chew but not [i]swallow,[] a lot of the time.[face:skeptical]/untouched. Not that I would expect our skullmonsters to chow down on cheese./[i]empty.[] Didn't want to explore it too long, was worried there'd be some Thrixl trap.>/>
~01~~panel_006~7_hero2=<hero2.exists:Makes sense it's maps. They're looking for a [i]place,[] and suspect our lore will lead them there.../>
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=<hero> gets a sudden prickle of memory.
~01~~panel_007~8_hero=<hero2.exists:/They must have reason to suspect an old human document of its location would exist.>
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=<hero2.exists:/<npc.mf:His/Her/Their> great library is out there in the wilds. If the enemy is poring over maps, that would be the ideal place for them to search.>
~01~~panel_008~8_hero=The rarest charts... were made by the mystic, <npc.fullname>. <hero2.exists:<npc.mf:His/Her/Their> great library is out there in the wilds, still. Dwarfs this one. If they're sniffing out maps, that's another place they'd go./>
~01~~panel_009~1_narration=It's nearing dark when <hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:<hero4.exists:<hero5.exists:<hero5>, /><hero4>, /><hero3>, <hero2>, and /<hero2> and ><hero> go/<hero> goes> to camp in the unspoiled air.
~01~~panel_009~2_narration=<deadHero.exists:<deadHero.2.exists:The dead will need burying. Then the trip to the Mapmage's great library can begin./<deadHero> should be buried. Then the trip to the Mapmage's great library can begin.>/The trip to the great library of the Mapmage, <npc.fullname>, will begin tomorrow.>
